The Leetspeak method uses  an alternative alphabet of numbers and symbols to replace various letters in words. For example, "leet" becomes "1337".

The letter "e" will be replaced with "3".

The letter "o" will be replaced with "0".

The capital letter "I" will be replaced with "1".

The letter "s" will be replaced with "z" unless it is the first letter of the word.
